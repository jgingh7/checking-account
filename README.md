# checking-account

The program will read in, from the console, the following for all checks that were not cashed as of the last time you balanced your checkbook:
- the number of each check (int),
- the amount of the check (double),
- and whether or not it has been cashed (1 or 0, ture or false, boolean in the array).

The program outputs
- the total of the checks cashed,
- the total of the deposits,
- what the new balance should be,
- and how much this figure differs from what the bank says the new balance is.

It also outputs two lists of checks:
- the checks cashed since the last time you balanced your checkbook
- and the checks still not cashed, in sorted order from lowest to highest check number.
